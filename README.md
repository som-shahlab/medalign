# MedAlign: A Clinician-Generated Dataset for Instruction Following with Electronic Medical Records

**MedAlign** is a benchmark dataset of *983 clinician-curated natural language instructions* grounded in *275 longitudinal EHRs*. It includes *303 reference responses* to support evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on clinical reasoning, timeline understanding, and multi-document synthesis.

> [!WARNING]  
> MedAlign is a **test-only benchmark**. It is *not* intended for supervised model training.

## üìä Dataset Contents

The benchmark includes:

| Component                        | Count        |
|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Patients                         | 275          |
| Clinical notes                   | 46,252       |
| Distinct note types              | 128          |
| Clinical events (OMOP format)    | 3.6 million  |
| Instructions (deduplicated)      | 983          |
| Reference responses              | 303          |

All EHR data is longitudinal and standardized using the **[OMOP Common Data Model (CDM)](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/)**.
